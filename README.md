# EEG-Processing
  This project aimed to develop an effective method for analyzing EEG biosignals, focusing on the analysis of brain electrical activity through EEG, emphasizing the importance of the different frequency bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma) and their significance in brain science. 
  Using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and various filters, we processed EEG signals to eliminate noise and artifacts, enhancing the quality of the data. We designed and tested both digital andanalog circuits using LabVIEW, implementing Low-Pass, High-Pass, Band-Stop and Band-Pass filters to isolate relevant EEG frequencies. 
  Our results demonstrated that our alternative circuit design, which required fewer materials, provided nearly identical results compared to the more complex setup.
